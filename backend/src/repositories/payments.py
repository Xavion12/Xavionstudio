"""PaymentRepository: payments and recorded refunds.

Payment numbers (PAY-2026-000001) are assigned inside the INSERT from the highest number of
the same year — an indexed range lookup on the UNIQUE payment_number column. D1 executes
writes one at a time, so numbers never collide (and the UNIQUE index would reject it anyway).
