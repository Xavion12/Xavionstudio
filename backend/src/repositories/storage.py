"""StorageRepository: database size, row counts and daily snapshots for storage monitoring.

The database size comes from D1 itself (the ``size_after`` value D1 reports with every query).
Exact row counts are only taken in the daily snapshot or on an explicit refresh — the
Data & Backup page normally reads the stored snapshot, which costs one row read.
